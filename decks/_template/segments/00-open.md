<!--
Twenty seconds. This room already runs Temporal in production — they did not
come for a bio, and a long intro reads as filler to engineers who have on-call
rotations.

Mia is the click. She earns the "Dog Dad" line and buys a laugh before the first
diagram.

Then one question to the room before the TOC, because the answer sets your
pacing for the next twenty minutes: "who here has a Workflow in production that
calls two systems that both change state?" Every hand goes up. Say: then you
already own a Saga, whether or not it is written down as one.

Read the six rows, do not explain them. Twenty minutes of teaching, then the
rest of the session is the lab.

Shape of the session worth naming out loud: the five teaching blocks map
one-for-one onto the five TODOs in the exercise. Nothing on a slide is
background material — every slide is a line they are about to type.

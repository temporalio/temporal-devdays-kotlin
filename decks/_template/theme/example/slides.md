One of the most interesting pieces of tech I've seen in years. Temporal does
to backend and infra what React did to frontend — the surface exposed to the
developer is a beautiful render() function to organize your backend workflows.

::pre-release::

Self-Hosted: Enable env or Labs mode. Cloud: invite only for Design Partners.

title: Durable Execution

::code::

```python
def process_order(order):
    check_fraud(order.order_id, order.payment_info)
    prepare_shipment(order)
    charge_confirm = charge(order.order_id, order.payment_info)
    shipment_confirmation = ship(order)
```

::default::

**Durable Execution** is a new abstraction. It is a fault-oblivious
development model that preserves full application state in the case of any
host or software failure. It ensures your apps and end-to-end services are
*correct and reliable*.

headline: Agent platform running long-lived, multi-step AI workflows
---

Runs long-lived agent workflows as part of its core platform. Agents react to
events from the tools their customers already use.

::challenges::

- Building complex agentic workflows on traditional queues was too complex
- Real-time observability gaps slowed troubleshooting
- Scaling needed to be straightforward

::solution::

- Adopted Temporal from day 0 for orchestration
- Easy scaling by adding more Workers
- Real-time observability for faster troubleshooting

::challenges::

- **High scale:** input billions of signals across many data sources
- **High impact:** recommendations that sales and marketing teams act on
- Complex, fragile architecture in the previous system

::solution::

- Temporal orchestrates the retrieval and summarization pipeline
- **Reduced LLM costs:** only send necessary context
- **More reliable:** complex pipeline simplified
